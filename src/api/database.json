Just give the entry a title and type away, whatever is on your mind!\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter you finish and click the button below, this post will be added below! All future entries will go in the same area, newest entry on top.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you decide to reword any thoughts, or update a post with more thoughts, each post will have an edit button that will allow you to update your post!\n<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally, if any post ends up being a \"MySpace\"-like well of shame, there's a delete button convienently placed beside the edit button. It will permanently remove the post from existence so that your pride may remain intact!\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease enjoy this very basic app!\n",

      "content": "C - creatable \nR - readable  \nU - updatable \nD - deletable  \n\nChallenges broken down: \n\n1. Render a Form \n2. If there are entries in the database already, render those below the form. \n2. Once an Entry is finished being created, save it to a database. \n3. Once that entry saves, render the Entry List from the database again so all entries show up. \n4. Add an option to delete an entry, from the DOM and the database. \n5. Make and entry editable, and save the changes to that entry on the database. \n6. Use Grunt and Browserify to write modular code, readable, and control the above actions from the main js file. \n7. Finally, style the page. \n\nDo this qualify as CRUD? I hope so!",
